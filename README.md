# The Outdated Android Starter Pack 
Getting a feel for android with these courses and quick apps

## Sprint 1 (2.4 - 2.18)
Spent the bulk of my time going through Udacity tutorials. I enrolled in the "Developing Android Apps" and "Firebase in a Weekend for Andriod" course. To my surpise the Developing Android Apps was rather informative and good jump starter. I mismanaged my time from week one so had to move on to firebass tutorials. This however, did not go far for I had other matters and am still bad at managing my time.

It was my goal to go through the courses, do I quick tutorial with Tensorflow and then create a small application on my own utilizing everything I've learned. But things happen and dependecies fail. However, this is not that much of an issue becasue it was not apart of our sprint and would be additional work. 

### Initial Concerns
There was an initial misunderstanding with my stance on Slack and availability to the team. My teammate initials could not grasp why I would purposely make not install Slack on my smart device.

My biggest challenge in life at the moment is delibrate navigation through each day. What I mean by this is, while one or two notifications from Slack are harmless; the harsh reality is that the fractured nature of Slack and other distractors are not isolated events but rather a continous stream of dopamine inducing noise. I am not suggesting that my teammates are not worth my time and that I do not want to be a part of this project. What I am trying convey is that I will use Slack at delibrately in a more focus way. Avoiding spontateneous commution with purposeful execution of my time and communication habits. 

This has been easier said then done. I have done a better job than what I initially thought I would do [in terms of communicating]. Friday Feburary 15th, I poorly managed my time and due to various reasons completely forgot to check in with my team. I only realized this when I checked Slack the night before our sprint review.
